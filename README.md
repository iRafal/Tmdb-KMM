# Tmdb-KMM

## The goal
The goal is to create a sample KMM app, where I can try to use new KMM related technologies and experiment with libraries.

## The App Topic
The app topic is a Movie. App is a clone of The Movie Data Base (TMDB) service mobile client.

## Architecture
- App logic is based on MVI architecture. Some kind of REDUX web architecture was used here. 
- App Ui has to be based on Compose.
- Remote connection with server is based on Ktor.

## Current state
- Added MVI layer
- Added Api layer

## TODO
- Implement UI
- Add local cache
- Implement more features (screens)
- Extend Api layer with new api calls
- Finalize architecture
- Try to add more tools to the project (ktlint, githab actions, and other which will be useful to try or to use)
